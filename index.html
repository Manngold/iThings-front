                  The APD (avalanche photodiode) is a high sensitivity
                  photodiode that operates at high gain by applying a reverse
                  bias. In order to ensure the constant gain of APD when
                  temperature varies, the handpiece is equipped with high-speed
                  type temperature-compensation bias algorithm. Once temperature
                  sensors detect the change of temperature, the microcontroller
                  starts to adjust the reverse voltage to make APD's gain
                  constant.It is designed to ensure the stable operation of APD
                  receiver over a wide temperature range without
                  TEC(thermoelectric cooler) and is suitable for applications of
                  the diffuse optical spectroscopy & imaging.

                  Electromechanical Reshaping (EMR) provides a means of
                  modifying the shape of cartilage. C²EMR is a 6-channel current
                  source which is designed for needle-electrode-based current
                  controlling Electromechanical Reshaping. The previous voltage
                  controlled- EMR (vcEMR) incurs the severe pain due to high
                  current during voltage application. However,the each channel
                  of the C²EMR simply controls the current output, which
                  delivers a stable and precision DC current ? up to 10mA with
                  0.1mA step to the cartilage. As a result, the developed C²EMR
                  would be helpful to remove or reduce the pain.

                  To obtain sufficient information for the separation of the
                  scattering and absorbance properties, the proposed approach
                  measures the light intensity of reflected beam at different
                  distances from the incident light beam. Since the light
                  intensities of reflected beam are measured at several
                  distances, we can find the distinct points between the sallow
                  penetration with low interaction in the tissue and the deep
                  one with thehigh interaction.
