                  The APD (avalanche photodiode) is a high sensitivity
                  photodiode that operates at high gain by applying a reverse
                  bias. In order to ensure the constant gain of APD when
                  temperature varies, the handpiece is equipped with high-speed
                  type temperature-compensation bias algorithm. Once temperature
                  sensors detect the change of temperature, the microcontroller
                  starts to adjust the reverse voltage to make APD's gain
                  constant.It is designed to ensure the stable operation of APD
                  receiver over a wide temperature range without
                  TEC(thermoelectric cooler) and is suitable for applications of
                  the diffuse optical spectroscopy & imaging.

                  Electromechanical Reshaping (EMR) provides a means of
                  modifying the shape of cartilage. C²EMR is a 6-channel current
                  source which is designed for needle-electrode-based current
                  controlling Electromechanical Reshaping. The previous voltage
                  controlled- EMR (vcEMR) incurs the severe pain due to high
                  current during voltage application. However,the each channel
                  of the C²EMR simply controls the current output, which
                  delivers a stable and precision DC current ? up to 10mA with
                  0.1mA step to the cartilage. As a result, the developed C²EMR
                  would be helpful to remove or reduce the pain.

                  To obtain sufficient information for the separation of the
                  scattering and absorbance properties, the proposed approach
                  measures the light intensity of reflected beam at different
                  distances from the incident light beam. Since the light
                  intensities of reflected beam are measured at several
                  distances, we can find the distinct points between the sallow

                  one with thehigh interaction.

                  digital coordinates of lesions, and then localize them for
                  targeted phototherapy. A DLP projector is adopted to generate

                  the digital images. In more detail, the projector and the
                  camera operate togenerate patterns andcapture the patterned
                  digital images sequentially. Finally, the 3D model is
                  constructed by a depth calculation, a point cloud and a 3D
                  polygon meshes in turn. With this 3D model, the therapeutic
                  light is controlled to illuminate the targeted areas such as
                  vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis,neonatal jaundiceetc.

                  attention recently for subwatt-scale energy harvesting systems
                  with supercapacitor-based energy storage. Supercapacitors,
                  also known as ultracapacitors or electrochemicaldouble layer
                  capacitors (EDLCs), have long lifecycles and high power

                  compensating for or overcomingtheir non-ideal behavior
                  attributed to the discharge (voltage-vs.-energy) curve,
                  substantial leakage currents, and charge redistribution. The

                  Recent advances in low-cost remote monitoring systems have
                  made it possible and practical to perform structural health
                  monitoring (SHM) on a large scale. However, it is difficult
                  for a single remote monitoring system to cover a wide range of
                  SHM applications due to the amount of specialization required.
                  For the remote monitoring system to be flexible, sustainable,
                  and robust, this research introduces a new cost-effective,
                  advanced remote monitoring and inspection system named
                  DuraMote. </span

                  The DuraMote effort started in 2008 as a NIST project. Funds
                  was received in 2009 and the PipeTECT project was
                  started.DuraMote uses Silicon Design's SD1221L-002
                  high-precision MEMS accelerometers in conjunction with a
                  QuickFilter chip (4-channel ADC+digital signal conditioning).
                  Its accelerometer performance has been extensively tested on a
                  shaker for 0.1 Hz to 300 Hz vibration.As of September 2011,
                  100 units of DuraMote are being manufactured and tested. We
                  have done field tests on the water pipes of OCSD (Orange
                  County Sanitation District) in Newport Beach, IRWD (Irvine
                  Ranch Water District) in Tustin, SAWPA (Santa Ana Watershed
                  Project Authority) in Corona, PACE (Pacific Advanced Civil
                  Engineering) in Costa Mesa, on Vincent Thomas Bridge in Long
                  Beach, and the new Hwamyung Bridge in Korea.
